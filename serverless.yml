# Welcome to Serverless!
#
# This file is the main config file for your service.  # It's very minimal at this point and uses default values.
# You can always add more config options for more control.  # We've included some commented out config examples here.
# Just uncomment any of them to get that config option.
#
# For full config options, check the docs:
#    docs.serverless.com
#
# Happy Coding!
